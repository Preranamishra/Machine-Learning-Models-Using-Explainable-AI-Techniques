# Project Title: Enhancing Interpretability in Machine Learning Models Using Explainable AI Techniques

## Author: Prerana Mishra

### Description

This project focuses on improving the interpretability of machine learning models through Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, specifically utilizing the CatBoost algorithm. Given the complexity of modern AI models, understanding their decision-making processes is crucial, especially in sensitive domains like healthcare. We use the Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset, which includes data from blood donors and Hepatitis C patients, to demonstrate how various XAI methods can clarify the predictions made by the CatBoost model.
Objectives

    To apply XAI techniques to enhance the transparency of the CatBoost algorithm.
    To analyze feature importance and interactions within the Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset.
    To foster trust in AI-driven decisions by providing clear explanations for model outputs.

### Techniques Used

    Permutation Feature Importance: Analyzes feature importance by permuting feature values and measuring changes in prediction error.
    SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): Utilizes game theory to calculate the contribution of each feature to the prediction for individual instances.
    Global Surrogate Models: Employs simpler models to mimic complex black-box models, providing insights into their decision-making processes.
    Tree Visualization: Visualizes decision trees to illustrate the steps leading to specific predictions, making it easier for non-technical audiences to understand.
    SHAP Dependence Plots: Displays the variability of feature impacts while accounting for interactions, offering a more comprehensive view of their influence on predictions.
